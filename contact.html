                        M7LO7 Demonstrate the use of radio buttons in a form
                        Radio buttons (AKA option buttons) are created here via the use of
                        the attribute 'type="radio"'. They are grouped together by having the
                        same name attribute, which means only one button may be selected at a
                        time.
                    -->
                    <label for="sYes">Yes</label>
                    <input name="use" value="yes" id="sYes" type="radio" />
                    <label for="sNo">No</label>
                    <input name="use" value="no" id="sNo" type="radio" />
                </div>

                        M7LO9 Demonstrate the use of a text area in a form
                        The textarea element creates a text area where users submit longer
                        form text. The sizing is done in the CSS rather than as an attribute.
                    -->
                    <label for="suggestions">How can we improve?</label>
                    <textarea name="improveSugg" id="suggestions"></textarea>

                <!--
                    M7LO10 Demonstrate the use of a submit button in a form
                    The input element down below is made a submit button via the attribute
                    'type="submit"'. It submits the form (which, due to the get method, puts
                    the info the user puts into the URL).
                -->
                <input id="submitButton" value="Submit This Survey" type="submit" \>

                M8LO8 Demonstrate the use of the <video> element for embedding video in a Web page (HTML)
                A video is displayed here of my dog sitting. The video is set to loop (as it is only two seconds)
                and also display controls. It does not autoplay, so otherwise it would be rather difficult to play.
                MP4 was chosen for the video as it seems to have the most support across browsers. If the video fails,
                a fallback message will be displayed.
            -->
            <video controls loop>
                <source src="LuluSitting.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                <p>If this message is showing, you need to update your browser to play this video.</p>
            </video>
            <!--
                M8LO9  Demonstrate the use of the iframe element (HTML)
                This is an iframe element to display a Youtube video of my dog embedded on the 
                webpage. A slight border is added, and the height and width are set as well, as 
                the book said to do that in the HTML instead of the CSS for unclarified reasons.
