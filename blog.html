                Rest is the most important one can do. It relieves all of the issues one may have. Too much work to do?
                Rest. You can't stress about work while resting. Ate too much food? Rest. You won't feel bloated while
                resting. If you aren't resting 24/7, then life isn't being done right. (Article written by Buster Blue.)

            <p>
                The best thing I ever did in my life was take the wheel. Given, I am a dog, so most of that involves
                aggressively nudging people into giving me what I want, but the point still stands. Since taking the
                wheel, I have gotten at least twice the treats and petting sessions. There are no downsides. Only
                upsides. (Article written by
                Lulu Sprague.)
